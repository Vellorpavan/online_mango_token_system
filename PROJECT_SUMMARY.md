## 📊 BUSINESS IMPACT

### Current Problem:
- **Farmer Waiting Time**: 2-3 days at factory
- **Travel Cost**: ₹500-1000 per trip
- **Crop Spoilage**: 15-20% loss
- **Factory Chaos**: Unmanaged crowds
- **Inefficiency**: Manual paper process

### After Implementation:
- **Waiting Time**: 0 days (book from home!)
- **Travel Cost**: 60-70% reduction
- **Crop Spoilage**: Minimal
- **Factory Efficiency**: 2x throughput
- **Digital Process**: 100% automated

### ROI Example:
- **50 farmers/day** × **2 days saved** = **100 farmer-days saved**
- **₹800 average cost/day** = **₹80,000 saved per day**
- **₹24,00,000 per month** in time/money savings
